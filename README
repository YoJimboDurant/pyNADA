This python program is an attempt to translate the R function ros from the package NADA (Lee 2013) into python 2. The function accepts 2 arguments - 
     obs: a list or numpy array of numbers
     cens: a boolean or list of 0,1 to indicate if obs values are censored (i.e. less than)
The expected return is a array containing the uncensored obs values, and the ros-imputed values for the censored values. 

I have not incorporated other functionality into the program yet, but would like to add:
  * data.frame method to return a data.frame type object similar to ros, which will contain obs, cens, plotting position and imputed values. 
  * a plotting method that will allow for display of the uncensored data and the regression line (and the imputed values)
  * methods to calculate mean, standard deviation, and standard error of mean
  * method to calculate confidence intervals using either bootstrapping or some other method appropriate when bootstrapping is infeasible due to small numbers.
